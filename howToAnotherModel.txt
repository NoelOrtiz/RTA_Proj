Theory:

	Create a copy of ModelClass.h/cpp and ShaderClass.h/cpp (something like SphereModelClass or whatever makes sense)
	Change the base vertex, index, and shader information (may be best to write simple pass-through shaders for now)
		Don't forget that we're using DrawIndexed and DrawIndexedInstanced. You shouldn't need the instance stuff, but if it's easier to leave it in, we can just set the numInstances to 1.
	In GraphicsClass.cpp, create the class object, initialize, and Render() where appropriate.
		// If everything goes well on my end, I'll be cleaning up GraphicsClass::Render() to make things easier to read.
		Cleaned up. Areas that are model-specific have been commented. Should just need to duplicate those calls for any other model. Testing begins.

That should be it. Let me know if this doesn't work out.
